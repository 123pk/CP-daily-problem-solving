Approach :- The operations said in problem statement is suitable for tree operation , a perfect complete binary tree is formed if we will perform the operations , so we will create
            the complete binary tree with operations and we will update leaf to root path which will take logn operations and overall time complexity of program is goint to ( m*log(n))
