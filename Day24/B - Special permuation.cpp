Platform :- Codeforces
Contest :- Educational Round 118
Approach :- first first the 'a' as first element and 'b' as first element of second half in array , use a map to only use unused values between 1 and n if we are not able to fill
           any half with given constrants then we print -1 , else we start filling max values in first half going from 'n' to >'a'and from 1 to <b' in second half, all used exactly one
           time
