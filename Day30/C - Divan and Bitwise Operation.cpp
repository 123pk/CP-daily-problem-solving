Contest :- Codeforces Contest 757 Div 2
APPROACH :- Here we need to know some key points that are each bit of any element is set 2^n-1 times while finding XOR of all subsequences ,
            so we will find OR of all the elements and sum of all XOR of all subesequence is ( OR_Value * 2^n-1 )% mod
