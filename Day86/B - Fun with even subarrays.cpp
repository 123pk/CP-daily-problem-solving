Platform :- Codefoces
Contest :- Codeforces Round 768 Div 2
Approach :- Start with the last element if the second last is not equal then we make it equal to last and increment our size and count of operation and descent to i-c index
            if we found some element which is already equal then we just add to our current pack and decrease the index .
