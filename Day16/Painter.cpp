Platform :- Coding Competition with Google
Approach :- First creat a vector of character which store the color required for creating all the combinations like for 'A'(Grey) it will store {'R','B','Y'} and so on 
            now we will look for how many times we need to color the boxes with each color individually , like for sequence GPR , we will color all 3 three cell in 1 time , 
            cell 1 and 2 with blue color in 1 time and cell 1 with color yellow in 1 time hence answer is 3 for this.
