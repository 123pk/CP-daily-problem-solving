/*
Platform :- Leetcode
Approach :- In c++ we have a function called "rand()" which generates random values from [0 to RAND_MAX ] range which is upto 32567 or so , we can create an array and store all
            the values of linked list and let m = 'size of array'  , and we chooose index as ( rand()%m ) as this will generate values in range [0,m) and return value at that index
