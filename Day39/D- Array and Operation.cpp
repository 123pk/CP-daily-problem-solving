Platform :- Codeforces
Contest :- Codeforces Round 760 Div 3
Approach :- Sort the array and since we need to minimise the sum , then we choose the last (n-(2*k)) elements as they contribute to the largest part of sum , we choose (n-2k,n-k),
           (n-2k+1,n-k+1)...and so on . This will help us in acheiving the desired sum.
