Platform :- Codeforces
Contest :- Codeforces Round 760 Div 3
Approach :- Since the elements at odd position shoudl be colored in same color and even position in same color and both colors need to be differnt , so we compute GCD of even index
           and odd index elements , if both of them is 1 then we cannot choose any such value , else we choose the values and check if any of them satisfy the condition or not .
