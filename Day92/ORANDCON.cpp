Approach :- there are two cases if we have only one bit set then we have two case :-
            1. When set bit is only 1 and values is '1' here we chhose 4,3,and 1 
            2. if the set bit is only 1 and 'n' is not '1' here we choose 'n' ,0 and bit next to set bit in third one
            we use greedy approach for seet bit count of 2 or more
