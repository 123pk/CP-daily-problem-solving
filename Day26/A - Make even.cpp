Contest :- If there is no even elemnt in our number then we cannot change it into even
           else we have three cases 
           Case 1 :- Already even  --> we didnot need to perform any operation 
           Case 2 :- First character or digit of number if even then we just need one operation and last digit is swapped with first digit and we get even number
           Case 3 :- We need 2 operations , in operation one we make first element even then it becomes case 2.
