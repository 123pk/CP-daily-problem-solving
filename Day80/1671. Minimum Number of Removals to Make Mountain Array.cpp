/*
Platform :- Leetcode
Approach :- Find LIS and LDS for each of the index , if LIS and LDS for each any index >=2 then the we can have a mountain sequence of size (LIS[i]+LDS[i])-1 , at the end we need 
            to find number of items we need to remove and that are going to be ( n - size_of_longest_mountain_sequence)
