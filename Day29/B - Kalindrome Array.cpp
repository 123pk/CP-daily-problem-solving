Platform :- Codeforces
Contest :- Codeforces Global Round 17
Approach :- Since we only need to remove one element we will look for the two elements A[i] & A[n-1-i] where A[i]!=A[n-1-i] , if removing any of these doesnot give us a palindromic
            array then we cannot create one else we can always create one .
