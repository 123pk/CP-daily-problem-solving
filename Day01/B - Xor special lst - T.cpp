Platform :- Codeforces
Contest :- Codeforces Round 752 Div 2
Approach :- The basic idea is for even size array we can choose subarray of size '1' and LIS is equal to 1 and xor of 1 even number of times is 0 ,
            for odd we need to find a subarray of size 2 whose LIS is 1 then it is possible else it is not.
